# rabies-graph-neural-model
This project explores a spatiotemporal modeling approach for rabies dynamics using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It proposes a method tailored for low-supervision contexts to enhance epidemiological surveillance and decision-making, particularly in resource-constrained environments.
